The AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System is a machine learning-based application designed to assist in medical diagnoses, particularly for diabetes prediction. The project leverages advanced machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, to classify medical data based on key health indicators.
Problem Statement:
Medical diagnosis, especially for diseases like diabetes, requires accurate analysis of multiple health parameters. Traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, highlighting the need for an automated, AI-driven solution to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and decision-making.
Objectives:
1.	Develop a machine learning model to predict medical conditions based on patient data.
2.	Compare multiple models to determine the most effective approach.
3.	Build an interactive web-based application for real-time diagnosis using Streamlit.
4.	Provide insights through model evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC score.
Methodology:
•	Dataset: The system utilizes the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset, which contains various medical parameters.
•	Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling using StandardScaler, and train-test splitting.
•	Model Training: Implementing and evaluating SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
•	Deployment: Using Streamlit to build a user-friendly web interface where users can input medical parameters and receive AI-driven predictions.
•	Key Results: The trained models achieved significant accuracy, with Random Forest performing the best in terms of precision and recall. The ROC curve analysis demonstrated a strong ability to distinguish between positive and negative cases.
Conclusion:
The AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System provides a fast, reliable, and interactive solution for medical predictions. By integrating machine learning with a user-friendly web interface, this system can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions. Future improvements include implementing Neural Networks, enhancing model evaluation through cross-validation, and refining the UI for better usability.
